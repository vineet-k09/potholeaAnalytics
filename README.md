# Bengaluru AI Road Guardian — Smart City Hackathon Project 🚗🛠️

## Overview 🌆
The Bengaluru AI Road Guardian project is an AI-driven pothole reporting web app designed to improve road safety in Bengaluru. It allows citizens to report potholes in real-time by submitting images, which are automatically processed using AI for pothole detection. The app also uses geolocation data captured via camera and geolocation APIs to pinpoint pothole locations with precision.

## Key Features 🔑
- **Pothole Reporting**: Users can capture and upload images of potholes 📸, which are processed to detect and report their severity.
