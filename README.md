# Bengaluru AI Road Guardian â€” Smart City Hackathon Project

## Overview
The Bengaluru AI Road Guardian project is an AI-driven pothole reporting web app developed to enhance road safety by enabling citizens to report potholes in real-time. Users can submit images of potholes, which are automatically detected using AI, while geolocation data is captured via camera and geolocation APIs to precisely identify the location of the potholes.

## Key Features
- **Pothole Reporting**: Users can capture and upload images of potholes, which are processed to detect and report their severity.
- **Automatic Geolocation**: Geolocation is detected via camera and geolocation APIs, ensuring accurate placement of potholes on the map.
- **Emergency Dashboard**: Designed a dynamic dashboard for emergency services to visualize live pothole reports with interactive maps (Leaflet.js) and case analytics (Chart.js).
- **Data Logging**: Integrated CSV logging for captured data, facilitating the back-end training of machine learning models for pothole auto-recognition.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js (if applicable for your back-end needs)
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning pipeline for pothole detection
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
